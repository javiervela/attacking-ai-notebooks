# Attacking AI

The two notebooks in this repository are used as an example of attacks on AI models.

1. [Poisoning Attack Spam Filter](./Poisoning_Attack_Spam_Filter/): Poisoning Attack on a Spam filter created using Support Vector Machines for Classification (SVC)
2. [Fast Gradient Sign Method Adversarial Attack](./Fast_Gradient_Sign_Method_Adversarial_Attack/): Input Attack on an Image Classification CNN using the Fast Gradient Sign Method and showing the effect of the adversarial patches in the predictions.
